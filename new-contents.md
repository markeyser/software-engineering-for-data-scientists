_Data Scientists (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician._

[source](http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/04/engineering-practices-in-data-science/)

The following article is mentions the opinion of Joel Grus abut software engineering in Data Science:

_Overall, Joel’s objections to Jupyter notebooks seem to come in large part from his somewhat philosophical view that **data scientists should follow the same set of best practices that any good software engineers would**. For instance, Joel stresses the importance of [writing unit tests](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-test-with-python-997ace2d8abe/?source=post_stats_page---------------------------) (even for data science code), and is a strong proponent of using type annotation (if you aren’t familiar with that, you should [definitely learn about it here](https://medium.com/@shamir.stav_83310/the-other-great-benefit-of-python-type-annotations-896c7d077c6b))._

The following topics are relevant for Data Scientists

- Modularity
- Documentation
- Testing
- version Control & Git

The above four topics comes from the introductory video in the following DataCamp couse:

[software engineering for data scientists in python datacamp lesson 1](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/software-engineering-for-data-scientists-in-python/software-engineering-data-science?ex=1)
>The above course don't cover version control and git topic.

Recently, Udacity also realesed a new version for their "[Data Science Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)" with the following information in the pdf version of the [syllabus](https://github.com/markeyser/software-engineering-for-data-scientists/blob/master/documents/Data%2BScientist%2BNanodegree%2BSyllabus.pdf):

- [Software-engineering-for-data-scientists-and-successfully-delivering-data-science-projects](https://ianozsvald.com/2019/04/24/software-engineering-for-data-scientists-and-successfully-delivering-data-science-projects-2-courses-for-may/)

We can see the agenda [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/software-engineering-for-data-scientists-tickets-66241132009?aff=erelexpmlt):

During the course we'll:

-   Develop defensive coding practices in our Notebook which double up as documentation
-   Refactor Notebook code into modules for reuse and increased trust
-   Add unit-tests to test our modules for trust and integration with a Continuous Integration pipeline
-   Review a git process that uses nbdime for collaboration on Jupyter Notebooks
-   Practice code reviews backed by a documented process you can take back to your team
-   Review a standard research-to-deployment process using cookiecutter  
    
-   Discuss how to sell these new techniques to team members and senior staff to get critical buy-in to see change occur after the course
-   Look at how "traditional" software engineering and "data science engineering" differ to highlight process differences that your software engineering colleagues probably haven't seen
-   Write useful documentation in our code to improve future support

## Logging 

The following presentation is really good:

- [Albert Sweigart, "Logging and Testing and Debugging, Oh My!", PyBay2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONCVvS-gDMA)

The speaker is the author of this [this book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter10/), here more information. 

The above talk is about logging, debugging, testing (doctest package). The discussion at the end of the presentation is really intesting. They talked about [this](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/04/06/stop-using-print-for-debugging-a-5-minute-quickstart-guide-to-pythons-logging-module/). 

By the way, an Atom package for debbuing [here](https://atom.io/packages/python-debugger).

## Packaging 

- [Creating-a-python-package-for-ubuntu-from-code-zero-to-apt-install](https://medium.com/@trstringer/creating-a-python-package-for-ubuntu-from-code-zero-to-apt-install-d02d0108144c)

## Online IDEs

- [Start Coding in Your Browser With Microsoft Visual Studio Online](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/coding-browser-microsoft-visual-studio-online/)

From the above article:

>###  Doesn’t This Already Exist?
>
>Fully online IDEs are nothing new and Amazon’s AWS Cloud9 IDE is a robust environment rich in features. Similarly, there are many online subscription services designed for smaller scale group development.
>
>There are even online IDEs which use VS Code’s open source codebase, and anyone familiar with the software will feel quite at home.
>
>Having a remote environment accessible both through the browser and locally is technically possible with any one of these services. In contrast what Visual Studio Online will likely do is make it a more streamlined and accessible experience

- [New online code editors and cloud-based IDEs](https://livablesoftware.com/new-online-code-editors-cloud-web-ide/)

PyCharm also comes with remote capabilities

[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/)

[programmer-browser-ides](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/programmer-browser-ides/)

[best-cloud-ides](https://www.slant.co/topics/713/~best-cloud-ides)

In the following article you can read about how PyCharm can do an interactive session like Hydrogen

- [Top 5 Python IDEs For Data Science](datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-science-python-ide)

So, it seems that at least PyCharm and Visual Studio Online has both:

- Ability to work remote againsts a server
- Interactive Python session with plots and tables

Here there is a clear view about how PyCharm provides Data Science funtionally:

[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/scientific_tools.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/scientific_tools.html)

Very intersting, Pychar can do remote:

- [Work remotely with PyCharm, TensorFlow and SSH](https://medium.com/@erikhallstrm/work-remotely-with-pycharm-tensorflow-and-ssh-c60564be862d)

There is a plugin for R in PyCharm

[https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6632-r-language-support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6632-r-language-support)

Py Charm free trial 30 days

[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windowsAnaconda](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windowsAnaconda)

## Deploying models

- [Managed-mlflow-on-databricks-now-in-public-preview](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/03/06/managed-mlflow-on-databricks-now-in-public-preview.html)
- [https://databricks.com/mlflow](https://databricks.com/mlflow)

## Model Tracking tools

- [Model Tracking Tools for Data Science (mlflow)](https://towardsdatascience.com/model-tracking-tools-for-data-science-mlflow-51b681f8452e)
It seems that MLFlow is replacing [modeldb](https://github.com/mitdbg/modeldb). There is no books related to this new software, so, here there is an opportunity to write a book. 
- [Getting started with mlFlow](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-mlflow-52eff8c09c61)

I've been reading that all the above software engineering technique could be really useful when compiting in Kaggle du to simplify a lot the work.

## OOP with Python

The following course from O'Reilly is also provided on Udemy (I already have the course bought). The course is really good.

- [Python beyond the basics object oriented programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-beyond-the-basics-object-oriented-programming/)
This course also seems interesting:

- [Learning-path-python-functional-programming-with-python](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-path-python-functional-programming-with-python/)

Hi All,

I found this course online to write better and maintainable python code – Check it out [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-developers-toolkit/table-of-contents). Things I found especially useful & can be easily integrated to our workflow:

-   Use of virtualenv - to create virtual environments to ensure that programs don’t crash due to package versioning.
-   Sphinx – to create documentation that can be hosted on either a web server or within our gitlab wiki. Example of current python projects using Sphinx [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/examples.html).

NYL has a partnership with Pluralsight so - **use the NYL email id to login**. Please feel free to forward to anyone who is using python on our team.
